## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict wine ratings based on descriptions and other features. The project includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the wine dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models, including linear regression, random forests, and fine-tuned language models.
- **Gradio Interface**: An interactive web interface for predicting wine ratings and suggesting similar wines.
